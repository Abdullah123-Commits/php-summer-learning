    # WE WILL BE LOOKING AT ARRAYS AND LOOPS

    /* THERE ARE 3 TYPES OF ARRAYS

        1) indexed
        2) associative
        3) multi-dimensional arrays

    /* 
        LET'S LOOK AT INDEXED ARRAYS
        There declaration and accessing is same as in C
        e.g

        print_r is a function that does the 
        same working as echo does on variables

        $cars = ["Honda","Toyota"];
    print_r($cars);
    $cars[] = "FORD";
    print_r($cars);

    count() is func that works on arrays and counts 
    the no of elements present.
