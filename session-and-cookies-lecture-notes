                                                            # PHP SESSIONS
In php , sessions are used to store some variable's values in an array of (SUPER_GLOBALS) to use them in multiple pages, this can be done by stating
the instruction : 'sessions_start() ' 

In the session array , we can also unset a value of session variable by using a function named ' unset()'.

session_destroy() => deletes every entity from the session array / SUPERGLOBAL array.

With 'sessions' the data is stored not on the client's device but on the server, whereas when using cookies so the data is stored on client's device.
For most of the times and use cases 'SESSIONS' are to be more conveniently used and very rarely cookies are used.
